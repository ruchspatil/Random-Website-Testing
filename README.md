Verify the correct generation of random numbers.<br>
Ensure that user input is correctly handled by the site.<br>
Validate page loading and UI interactions.<br>
Perform regression testing on the website random number generation features.

## Technologies Used:

Python: Programming language used for test scripting.<br>
Selenium WebDriver: Web automation tool used for browser interaction.<br>
unittest: Python testing framework used to structure and execute tests.<br>
ChromeDriver: WebDriver used for automating Chrome browser (other browsers can also be used).
